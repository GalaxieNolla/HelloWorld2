## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented features:

## Extra Features
* [ ] Image at top acting as a header to pay homage to "Hello World" inspiration behind app
* [ ] GIF acting as image
* [ ] Centered text to improve legibility
* [ ] Equal spacing between header, image, text, and button
  

## Notes/Challenges
* [ ] Getting the gif to properly display when opening the app. Presents itself as an image rather than the collection of images (gif)
* [ ] Changing the size of the text -- trying to increase size to improve legibility
* [ ] Linking a video as another button/linking another video with the button
* [ ] Adding fonts and color options. Stuck with default/sample fonts & colours but a greater variety of fonts & colours could improve GUI
* [ ] Changing the colour of the button. Was able to change the colour of the text but not the button itself
